Desired functionality:

The 'ContractExample.sol' file contains code for a contract we were able to compile and test on Rinkeby.
The hidden image showed, and when we set reveal to true the images were shown no problem!

Here's a link to the contract on etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d0d57d004f82e9f4471caa8b9f8b1965a814154#code

Of course, the only thing we couldn't figure out was the merkle proof!

WhitelistAddresses.json file contains all of the addresses that will have access to the whitelist sale!


Front-End:
We dont intend on doing anything fancy for this. Going for functionality/practicality. So we've opted to use the Hashlips Dapp. It comes out of the box with everything we'll need, plug and play.
If you're unfamiliar with the hashlips dapp, he has a wonderful YouTube tutorial that touches on everything. Here's a link if you get confused: https://youtu.be/fzH7Gjadmj0?t=7606

Back-End/General thoughts on all things coding:

I know you need to do more complicated things on the back-end because of the merkle proof. You have full discretion to use whatever naming conventions you'd like in order to
get the contract functional with the merkle proof. 

The desired outcome, of course, is to have everything wired up to the front-end and working with the merkle proof. Once everything works on Rinkeby (or whatever testnet you prefer using), we'll 
reconvene and deploy to mainnet.

If we're missing anything, or you're confused on anything, please let me know!

Otherwise, please estimate to the best of your ability roughly how long all of this will take so we can make sure compensation is fair. Thanks Maxim!
